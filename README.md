# Stock-
Stock Analysis and Forecast â€“ ML project in Python---neiral network
-----------------
Introduction .
In my thesis work I got idea to start experimenting   hands-on Machine Learning projects   on Stock Prices Predictor.  Today are companies on the lookout for software that can monitor and analyze the company performance and predict future prices of various stocks.

Machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction. In this machine learning project, we will be talking about predicting the prices on stocks. This is a very complex task and has uncertainties. 

We will develop this project into two parts:
1.	First, we will learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network.
2.	We will use Decision Tree Regression and Linear Regression methods  to predict and compare  result with LSTM .
3.	Then we will build a dashboard using Plotly dash for analysis of Tesla stocks.


This thesis work will show you  a market analysis and forecasting tool implemented as a Python code in VisualStudio Code with help of the keras , pandas , numpy and another library
